## What Is AdPlay?

AdPlay lets you run digital signage on your local network without depending on a cloud service.

You can:
- upload videos
- group them into playlists called **Profiles**
- open the player on TVs, tablets, or monitors
- assign a different profile to each screen

It is designed for places like:
- cafes
- restaurants
- retail stores
- offices
- reception desks

## Who This README Is For

This README is written for two groups:

1. **Non-technical users**
Use the quick start section to get the system running and show videos on a screen.

2. **Developers / people forking the project**
Use the developer sections to understand the codebase, local development flow, media pipeline, and where to make changes.

---

## Quick Start For Non-Technical Users

### What you need

- A computer that will host AdPlay
- A TV, tablet, or monitor on the same Wi-Fi or LAN
- Node.js installed on the host computer

### Start the app

#### macOS / Linux

Development mode:

```bash
./start.sh
```

Production mode:

```bash
./start.sh prod
```

#### Windows

Double-click:

```text
start.bat
```

Then choose development or production mode.

### Open the admin dashboard

In development mode:

```text
http://localhost:4200/admin
```

In production mode:

```text
http://localhost:3000/admin
```

Default login:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin`

### Add content

1. Upload one or more videos
2. Create a Profile
3. Add videos into that Profile's playlist

### Open the player on a TV or tablet

1. Make sure the screen device is on the same local network
2. Use the local IP shown by AdPlay in the terminal
3. Open that address in the TV or tablet browser
4. Choose a profile and start playback

Example:

```text
http://192.168.1.50:4200/player
```

or in production mode:

```text
http://192.168.1.50:3000/player
```

### Important notes

- Keep the AdPlay window or terminal open while the system is running
- The first tap on a TV may be needed to enable sound or fullscreen
- Large uploads may continue in chunks if the network is unstable
- Videos may be optimized in the background after upload

---

## Quick Troubleshooting

### I cannot open the admin page

- Make sure the app is still running
- Check whether you started development mode or production mode
- Use `4200` for frontend dev mode
- Use `3000` for production mode

### My TV cannot load the player

- Make sure the TV is on the same Wi-Fi/LAN
- Use the host computer's local IP, not `localhost`
- Check whether your firewall is blocking local access

### Upload feels slow

- AdPlay now uploads in chunks, so unstable networks are handled better
- Very large files still depend on local network speed
- Videos may keep processing after the upload reaches 100%

### Video uploaded but is still processing

- That is normal
- AdPlay uploads first, then optimizes in the background
- If optimization does not improve the file, AdPlay keeps the original video

## Codebase Map

### Top level

- `frontend/` Angular admin UI and player UI
- `backend/` Express API, upload handling, streaming, local JSON storage
- `start.sh` simple launcher for macOS/Linux
- `start.bat` simple launcher for Windows

### Frontend

- `frontend/src/app/features/dashboard/`
  Admin dashboard for uploads, profiles, and system status
- `frontend/src/app/features/player/`
  Screen player experience used on TV/tablet devices
- `frontend/src/app/features/auth/`
  Admin login flow
- `frontend/src/app/services/`
  API and auth services
- `frontend/src/app/shared/`
  Shared UI components, toasts, helpers

Important frontend files:

- `frontend/src/app/features/dashboard/admin.ts`
- `frontend/src/app/features/dashboard/dashboard.store.ts`
- `frontend/src/app/features/dashboard/resumable-upload.service.ts`
- `frontend/src/app/features/player/player.ts`
- `frontend/src/app/features/player/player-session.service.ts`
- `frontend/src/app/services/api.service.ts`

### Backend

- `backend/src/routes/`
  Express routes
- `backend/src/services/`
  Business logic
- `backend/src/middleware/`
  Auth, logging, request IDs, error handling
- `backend/src/db.ts`
  Local JSON-backed repository
- `backend/src/config.ts`
  Environment config and paths

Important backend files:

- `backend/src/app.ts`
- `backend/src/routes/video.routes.ts`
- `backend/src/routes/profile.routes.ts`
- `backend/src/services/video.service.ts`
- `backend/src/services/media.service.ts`
- `backend/src/services/upload-session.service.ts`
- `backend/src/db.ts`

---

## How The App Works

### Basic flow

1. Admin logs in
2. Admin uploads videos
3. Backend stores the uploaded file locally
4. Backend creates a video record in `db.json`
5. Backend may optimize the video in the background with FFmpeg
6. Admin creates profiles and assigns videos to them
7. A player device opens `/player/:profileSlug`
8. The player requests profile data and streams each video from the backend

### Storage model

AdPlay uses local file storage plus a local JSON database.

- uploaded video files live under `backend/uploads/`
- processed videos live under `backend/uploads/processed/`
- resumable upload session state lives under `backend/uploads/.sessions/`
- app data lives in `backend/db.json`

This keeps the project simple to run and easy to fork, but it is not meant to be a distributed storage architecture.

---

## Media Pipeline

AdPlay now has a more complete media pipeline than a simple single POST upload.

### Uploads

- uploads are **resumable**
- files are uploaded in chunks
- interrupted uploads can continue instead of restarting from zero

### Processing

- after upload, the backend may optimize the video with FFmpeg
- optimization happens in-process in the current server
- if the optimized file is smaller and usable, AdPlay serves it
- if optimization is worse, AdPlay keeps the original file

### Streaming

- playback uses `/api/videos/:id/stream`
- the backend supports HTTP range requests
- small ready videos may be cached by the player
- large videos stream directly to avoid wasting browser memory

### Current limitation

This is a strong local-first media pipeline, but it is still not a full media platform:

- no distributed job queue
- no HLS/DASH adaptive streaming
- no object storage / CDN integration
- no thumbnail sprite generation

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside `backend/`.

Example:

```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
JWT_SECRET=change-me
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB=2048
MEDIA_TRANSCODE_ENABLED=true
RESUMABLE_CHUNK_SIZE_MB=8
```

### Main variables

- `PORT`
  Backend port

- `JWT_SECRET`
  Secret used for admin auth tokens

- `ADMIN_USERNAME`
  Default admin username

- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
  Default admin password

- `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB`
  Maximum allowed upload size in MB

- `MEDIA_TRANSCODE_ENABLED`
  Enable or disable FFmpeg optimization

- `RESUMABLE_CHUNK_SIZE_MB`
  Chunk size for resumable uploads

### Optional path overrides

- `DB_FILE`
- `UPLOADS_DIR`
- `FRONTEND_DIST_DIR`

These are mostly useful for tests, custom deployments, or forks.

## Where To Change Things

### I want to change the admin UI

Start in:

- `frontend/src/app/features/dashboard/`
- `frontend/src/app/shared/ui/`

### I want to change the player UI

Start in:

- `frontend/src/app/features/player/player.html`
- `frontend/src/app/features/player/player.css`
- `frontend/src/app/features/player/player-session.service.ts`

### I want to change upload behavior

Start in:

- `frontend/src/app/features/dashboard/resumable-upload.service.ts`
- `backend/src/routes/video.routes.ts`
- `backend/src/services/upload-session.service.ts`
- `backend/src/services/video.service.ts`

### I want to change media optimization

Start in:

- `backend/src/services/media.service.ts`

### I want to change data storage

Start in:

- `backend/src/db.ts`

### I want to replace local JSON with SQLite/Postgres

The cleanest seam is:

- keep the route layer
- keep the service layer
- replace the repository behavior inside `backend/src/db.ts`

---

## Good Forking Ideas

Common things people may want to add:

- image support in addition to video
- schedule-based playback
- remote/cloud sync
- SQLite or Postgres instead of `db.json`
- per-screen device registration
- multi-user admin roles
- HLS output for larger deployments
- thumbnails and media previews
- audit logs and analytics

---

## Production Notes

If you run this in production:

- change the default admin credentials
- set a strong `JWT_SECRET`
- use production mode
- keep regular backups of `db.json` and the `uploads/` folder
- make sure the host machine has enough disk space for raw and optimized videos
